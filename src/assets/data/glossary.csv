Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP),"Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover (Moss et al., 2008)",代表性浓度路径,一组包括了所有温室气体、气溶胶和化学活性气体 排放和浓度时间序列，以及土地利用/土地覆盖状况的情景,"From Arup's city tool. IPCCSR1.5

The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes the fact that not only the long-term concentration levels but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome are of interest (Moss et al., 2010). RCPs were used to develop climate projections in CMIP5."
Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP),"Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) were developed to complement the RCPs with varying socio-economic challenges to adaptation and mitigation (O’Neill et al., 2014)",共享社会经济路径,反应辐射强波和社会经济发展的关联,"From Arup's city tool. IPCCSR1.5

Based on five narratives, the SSPs describe alternative socio-economic futures in the absence of climate policy intervention, comprising sustainable development (SSP1), regional rivalry (SSP3), inequality (SSP4), fossil–fuelled development (SSP5) and middle-of-the-road development (SSP2) (O’Neill, 2000; O’Neill et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017). The combination of SSP-based socio-economic scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)-based climate projections provides an integrative frame for climate impact and policy analysis."
Risk,The potential for adverse consequences where something of value is at stake and where the occurrence and degree of an outcome is uncertain.,风险,气候相关危害与人类和自然系统的暴露度和脆弱性相互作用而产生不良后果的可能,"Used in Arup's city tool. IPCC SR1.5

In the context of the assessment of climate impacts, the term risk is often used to refer to the potential for adverse consequences of a climate-related hazard, or of adaptation or mitigation responses to such a hazard, on lives, livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and infrastructure. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability (of the affected system), its exposure over time (to the hazard), as well as the (climate-related) hazard and the likelihood of its occurrence."
